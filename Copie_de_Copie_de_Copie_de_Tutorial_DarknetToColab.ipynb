        "2.  **Número de Filtros:** Na camada `[convolutional]` imediatamente anterior a cada `[yolo]`, mude a linha `filters=255` (ou o valor atual) para `filters=21`. (Cálculo: `(classes + 5) * 3 = (2 + 5) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21`).\n",

        "5.  **Source Code Patching (`src/dark_cuda.c`, `src/network.c`, `src/yolo_layer.c`)**: Introduced `NULL` checks before `cudaFree` calls and corrected memory deallocation types (e.g., `cuda_free_host` for host-pinned memory) in the Darknet source code to prevent invalid pointer arguments.\n",

I will fix this by enclosing the `backup` path in double quotes, which is standard practice for paths with spaces in configuration files and resolves Python's string parsing issue. Additionally, I will refine the Makefile modifications for the AlexeyAB repository to ensure the correct CUDA/cuDNN include paths are set and avoid unnecessary or incorrect `LDFLAGS` changes, as the AlexeyAB Makefile already has reasonable defaults for LDFLAGS. I will also ensure the custom data files are correctly copied/regenerated within the newly cloned Darknet directory.\n",

This error indicated a call to `cudaFree(x_gpu)` with an invalid pointer and was not resolved despite extensive debugging. Troubleshooting efforts included:\n",
        "    *   Correcting Makefile paths for CUDA and cuDNN libraries to `/usr/local/cuda-12.5/targets/x86_64-linux/lib`.\n",
        "    *   Reinstalling cuDNN.\n",
        "    *   Adjusting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\n",
        "    *   Modifying `yolov3.cfg` parameters (batch, subdivisions, `random=0`, reduced image dimensions).\n",
        "    *   Patching `src/dark_cuda.c` with a `NULL` check before `cudaFree` and correcting `cuda_free_host` calls in `src/network.c` and `src/yolo_layer.c`.\n",
        "    *   Attempting static linking (`LIBSO=0`).\n",
        "    *   Attempting training without pre-trained weights.\n",
        "*   The `CUDA Error: invalid argument` was indicative of a fundamental incompatibility or bug within the initial Darknet fork's memory management when interacting with the Google Colab CUDA 12.5 environment.\n",
        "*   Switching to the AlexeyAB/darknet repository successfully resolved the persistent CUDA error. This repository required specific Makefile configurations for the Colab environment, including enabling `GPU=1`, `CUDNN=1`, `OPENCV=1`, `LIBSO=1`, and setting `ARCH= -gencode arch=compute_75,code=[sm_75,compute_75]` for the T4 GPU.\n",
        "*   Directly specifying Google Drive paths (e.g., `/content/gdrive/My Drive/darknet_AlexeyAB_version/backup`) as the `backup` location in `obj.data` caused \"Couldn't open file\" errors with the AlexeyAB Darknet. This was successfully bypassed by creating a local backup directory (`./backup_local`) within the Darknet repository and configuring `obj.data` to use this local path.\n",
        "*   Training with the AlexeyAB Darknet fork successfully commenced, with weights being saved to the local `./backup_local` directory, which mirrors to the designated Google Drive path at `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/darknet_AlexeyAB_version/backup`.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   When encountering persistent, low-level CUDA errors in specialized deep learning frameworks like Darknet within environments like Colab, it is highly recommended to try alternative, actively maintained forks of the software, as compatibility issues with newer CUDA versions are common.\n",
        "*   Avoid using complex file paths, especially those containing spaces, directly within configuration files for command-line tools like Darknet, particularly for backup or data locations on mounted drives. Utilizing simple relative paths or symbolic links to local directories for such configurations can circumvent unexpected file access errors.\n"
